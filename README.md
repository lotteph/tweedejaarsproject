# Predicting generation of energy using weather reports

> We are like tenant farmers chopping down the fence around our house for fuel when we should be using Nature's inexhaustible sources of energy -- sun, wind and tide.... I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.

## Getting Started

This codebase can predict the output of a solar panel using the historic output of one of more solar panels.

## Running the code

This codebase consists of multiple maps, each with it's own functionality. The most important ones for the main functionality are the main, train and test maps. The training data has to be placed inside the folder named train, the test data in the test folder, and the training and testing functions are run from the main folder and specifically main.py.

## Requirements of the training and test data

The weather data used by create_pandas.py should be generated using the Weather_test.py file.
The Solar panel data should be generated by scrape.py. This is done more easy through match.py If one would like to use their own data, this data should have the same properties as if it was generated by match.py.

### Running the main module

To use the functionality of this module, first import main.py in any python environment. Importing this file will automatically import the other necessary python files. Inside the main module, there is one class one could call. And there are multiple functions outside of the class which call this central class multiple times.

#### A Predictor object

When initialized, this class loads all of the data from the train and test folders. It then puts these files together in the x and y of the training and test set. It assigns these as properties of the object. The class has different functions which are models that can be trained and fitted on the data.

##### train_nn

Trains a recurrent neural network,
