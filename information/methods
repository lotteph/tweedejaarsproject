Modelling algorithms: actually classification algorithms..

LOGISTIC REGRESSION: not useful
- for binary classification problems
- looks like a big S

Linear Discriminant Analysis: not useful
- two-class classification problems
- find clusters with mean an variance

K-Nearest-Neighbour: maybe useful but probably less efficient and correct than
linear regression
- Mostly used for classification problems
- New data point, which class?

Neural Networks:
...


Feature extraction:

PCA:
- reduce dimentions of the data
(so from 3D define the surface of the data in 2D)
- SCIKIT LEARN algorithm:

Isomap:
- non linear dimentionality reduction
- uses k nearest neighbours to find neighbour path, calculates shortest path and
finally computes lower dimentional embedding
