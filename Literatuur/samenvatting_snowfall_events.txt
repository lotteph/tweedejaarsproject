Prediction of Energy Effects on Photovoltaic Systems due to snowfall events

Performs methods to identify snowfall from performance data
Recommends prediction model
More accurate for low tilt angles

Best PV performance on high latitudes -> more snow as well
Snow losses can contribute to 20% loss

previous made model had a lot of scatter, was rejected

Impact of snow:
    - less light on PV panel, thus less Energy
    - increase in relative PV performance, due to increased albedo present

Model tries to reduce biases from spectral effects

Due to the workings of MPPT circuits, the coverage of one panel will influence
the performance of the entire circuit.
Because modules are intentionally over sized for  a given inverter the fraction
of energy production in the winter time if proportionally larger than if the
clipped power in the summer is produced.

This all results in a 4.25% loss of energy due to snowfall.
